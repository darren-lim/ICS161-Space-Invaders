Requirement Description:

The Player used a basic sprite and used movement modification on the rigidbody velocity for movement.
We used a special bullet object that would modifiy a static variable in the player logic code to prevent
more than one bullet being active at one time. If a player would miss there would be a trigger above the 
play area in order to destroy stray bullets. The player logic code also has a static varible live counter to account
for death of the player.

For a game over senario there is a special trigger very slightly above the player to recognize if the enemies had reached
the bottom of the screen. Code would also trigger a game over if the static lives variable would reach 0. When this state
is reached the player is given the option to play again or quit with buttons for each option, and your final score is
desplayed.

For our UI we used Text Mesh pro to desplay text. Text is desplayed at on the top right and top left for lives and score
respectivly. There is also a start screen that allows a player to enter the game or quit. Menus also appear for win and death senarios. 

For a win a game over is triggered and your final score is desplayed, much like the game over if you die.
When restarting the game the same scene is reloaded and you start from the beginning. 

EXTRA CREDIT:

A pause menu was implamented using Time.timeScale. A resume button and a quit button are shown on the pop up menu
